    <p style="text-align: center;">InternConnect is a platform designed to help local students find internships in their own district. Many students struggle to find opportunities near them, especially in rural areas, and InternConnect is here to bridge that gap by connecting students with local businesses that need interns.</p>

    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><u>Our Mission</u></h3>
    <p style="text-align: center;">Our mission is to empower students by offering them the chance to gain hands-on experience while remaining in their community. InternConnect works to create more opportunities for youth to grow professionally without the need to travel far from home.</p>

    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><u>How It Works</u></h3>
